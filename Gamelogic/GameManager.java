 *  - Can pick a random question and it's answers from a read in text/config file
 *  - Can package a "Question" element to be sent to the server class and blasted out to clients
 *  - Tracks scores of "Players" (Potentially need a player object to track who's who)
 *  - Handles the logic of a "Round" (a period of time in which the players can buzz in to answer the question, 
 *  and the steadily reducing point total for how long it takes players to answer)
